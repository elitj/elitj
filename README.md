### About me
#### Current Work
I'm Eli Johnson, and I love finding patterns in data and illuminating them.  Currently I work at Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) as a Data and Reports Specialist.  In my position, I:

- Write and maintain queries (both ad hoc and dedicated) to help staff better understand the clients we serve
- Build new features into a proprietary Electronic Health Record (EHR) with over 100,000 unique clients
- Automate and facilitate database-to-database communication with various health and governmental agencies
- Troubleshoot, resolve and prevent errors arising from these data interfaces
- Ensure data integrity, security, and compliance with HIPAA and other regulations
- Document it all as I go!

#### Education
I studied math at the University of Washington, where I earned an MS in Mathematics. I also taught calculus and differential equations there.  

I got my BA in Mathematics and American Indian Studies (double major) from the University of Minnesota.

Here's [my Master's thesis](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiqmeDC7t31AhVJkokEHVM1AukQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdigital.lib.washington.edu%2Fresearchworks%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F1773%2F44375%2FJohnson_washington_0250O_20487.pdf%3Fsequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy&usg=AOvVaw0HYsbQ0t7AMb1FIhmnj4SP).  It's quite technical, but it also has some nice pictures (generated using Sagemath and Geogebra).
Mathematicians have been using a model called the Abelian Sandpile to study systems that are in a sense barely stable (and might show a large response to small changes).  Sandpiles have been used to analyze everything from forest fires to the stock market to neural activity in the brain.  My thesis describes a way to compute sandpile changes much more efficiently by exploiting symmetries in the initial "picture".  It also analyzes the properties of sandpiles on a hexagonal grid.

#### Current Projects
Currently I'm reading The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman).  I'm writing a Sudoku solver in PHP.  I'm also designing a relational database for Dungeons and Dragons which encodes the mechanics of the game.
